# sentitweet-ioT
Sentitweet is an artwork created by Marion Schneider at UQAM.  It consists of a Twitter bot searching with the Query "This artwork is" and analysing the related sentiment of each Tweet. It then displays a real-time value on a TFT screen and prints out some of the tweets on a Thermal Printer via WIFI connected ESP8266 (wemos).
